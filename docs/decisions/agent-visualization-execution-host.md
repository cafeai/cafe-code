# Decision: Full-access ordinary browser documents in chat

Decision status: Accepted current design; implemented
Last updated: 2026-10-13 22:28:00 JST (UTC+0900)
Decision authority: the user explicitly requests direct chat embedding, enables
visualization MCP only under Full access, asks that earlier feature decisions be
rewritten to this model, and authorizes pushing this current changeset.
Implementation/evidence status: current code implements this design; repeat the
canonical qualification commands for the exact source. Decision acceptance and
historical evidence are not current release or live-adoption proof.
Current authority: [Full-access embedding](agent-visualization-inline-access.md).

## Context and decision

Execute source in ordinary unsandboxed same-origin srcdoc frames in the main conversation. There is no separate Electron source host, dedicated source preload, native-view geometry bridge or execution watchdog in the active production path. A frame is a lifecycle/layout container, not a security boundary.

The user explicitly selected direct embedding and Full access as the enabling risk boundary. Parent DOM is not used to inject markup, but the same-origin frame can still access parent authority. Offline CSP, immutable bytes, finite source/frame counts and removal on visibility loss do not promise hard CPU/RAM/GPU limits. Remove an offscreen document rather than display a saved bitmap.

## Security, compatibility and failure consequences

This is deliberately privileged same-origin code. Full access does not make
source trustworthy or establish resource containment. Ordinary browser frames,
offline presentation and source commitments cannot prevent use of parent
authority. Current policy/ownership loss denies future reads/actions and removes
current documents; no restricted-mode fallback is admitted.

Preserve exact source/provenance/private ownership, finite data/resource work and
fresh configured App-operation consent. Generic attachment/Mermaid/provider and
native file-save policies are unchanged. No dependency/runtime/lock refresh,
installation, OS change, provider/profile access or live runtime reset is needed.
Existing owned history remains immutable and no saved poster is deleted.

## Verification and supersession

The user explicitly replaces the prior feature architecture and requests rewriting
these public decisions. Private historical evidence remains historical, not a
pass for the current browser path. Verify authoritative Full-access gates, real
interaction/layout/partial-scroll identity, offscreen teardown, font/fluid/private
data and App consent as relevant. Run required repository checks and the final
forced desktop build on unchanged source.

See [the guide](../agent-visualizations.md) and
[replay/CI qualification](../visualization-ci-qualification.md).
Local synthetic checks do not prove user-owned live adoption, installed OS
dialogs/IME/accessibility or hosted native-platform release delivery.
